                                <h3>Experience</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Born and raised in Southern California, I currently hold a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from CSUMB and a Master's of Science in Business Analytics from USC.
                                	I have working experience as a software engineer at a two different companies and as the Database Analyst of Research at USC's Marshall school of business.
                                	That role was primarily building out the ETL infrastructure to acquire data on research materials and make it valuable for our database.
                                	I was also the primary point of contact for ad hoc data/analysis requests from faculty and research orgs.
                                	I have since been working as a freelance/contract software development generalist, but am looking for a more consistent and permanent positions.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Art</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Alongside my technical experience, I have pursued artistic fields since I could read.
                                	I started learning piano/music theory at the age of 4 and continued to pick up more instruments throughout my life.
                                	I've even had a few opportunities to play internationally.
                                	To this day, I write and produce music when I find the time.
                                	I started taking interest in visual mediums sometime during middle school.
                                	Wanting to be a youtube star, I would film and edit (not very good) videos with my friends and still edit for friends' Youtube channels from time to time.
                                	Digital art and illustration would become my focus during freshman year of highschool.
                                	To this day, drawing and painting is still a very large part of my life.
                                	Starting in undergrad, I began learning game development and 3D tools.
                                	Using a stolen copy of Maya, I learned 3D modeling and rigging and also built a simple render engine from the ground up using openGL and raw GLSL.
                                	More recently, I've made a few game concepts using Unreal, blender, and ZBrush. I've also been trying my hand at 2D animation, but still have a lot to learn.
                                	Looking to the future, I want to combine both my technical expertise and my lifelong love of the arts.

                                            <h2>Art Reference Catalog Fullstack App</h2>
                                            <h3>2022</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                After drawing and painting for several years, I accumulated hundreds of reference images on my local harddrive.
                                            	There were countless times in which I would want to find a specific image to reference, but I would then have to look through hundreds of images to find it.
                                            	Even with all the images categorized, this was often very difficult.
                                            	So I decided to build a full stack app to save the image names along with user added tags.
                                            	The user can upload an image and enter information for the image: character name, source name, body type, NSFW filter, and tags.
                                            	You can search for images via this information or view random images with or without a filter.
                                            	You can also screen for NSFW images if that is something you want to avoid.
                                            	The app is fullstack with an adaptive front-end and uses cloud storage via MongoDB atlas. 
                                            </p>

                                            <p>
                                                In 2019, I got interested in world-building and writing stories for these fictional worlds. Part of that was developing written and spoken languages.
                                            	One difficulty in that, is remembering definitions of the potentially hundreds of words your conlang may have.
                                            	Initially, I was storing everything on a google doc, but this quickly became too complicated.
                                            	So instead, I built a CLI tool that allows you to add, edit, and delete words and their definitions.
                                            	There was no need for a traditional DB solution, so it is simply a collection of specific JSON operations.
                                            	However, it was really helpful and is an excellent example of successfully filling a need and creating a time-saver with what I have learned.

                                            <p>
                                                This was my senior year capstone project in which we trained a deep learning model on the Google Cloud Platform in order to help deep sea researchers identify and track benthic life.
                                            	The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute had seafloor imaging stations that would capture an image of the sea floor every hour for an entire year.
                                            	Afterwards, they would have ~8000 images to look through to identify any lifeforms captured by the camera.
                                            	This is a very time-consuming task and very tedious.
                                            	Our project was to provide an automated solution using Deep learning and Computer Vision.
                                            	We were to train a, at the time, bleeding edge DL model called RetinaNet.
                                            	The model was so new, much of the cloud infrastructure on GCP was not equipped to run this model and we were forced to build much of those processes.
                                            	I specifically worked on the tensorflow record transfer and training/inference portion of the pipeline.

                                            <h3>2018</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                I wanted to learn how to make a game engine with my friend. So we set out to build one using OpenGL and GLSL.
                                            	Following a tutorial, we managed to build a very simple engine that could load objects, apply shaders, and allow camera movement.
                                            	Afterwards, I wanted to do something fun and decided to make an audio visualizer using shaders as the frequency response.
                                            	Built in the same stack, you can pass an audio file to the program, it will then play the file and use FFT to extract frequency information.
                                            	It then bins the frequency range and each bin is attached to some parameter in the lighting shaders.
                                            	I didn't know too much about how to make 3D lighting look good at the time and the frequency response is not that good, but I was still able to get a result.

                                            <p>
                                                BCK_RM was intended to be a puzzle/quest game set in the backrooms.
                                            	Players would traverse the backrooms to find clues to potentially solve real-world puzzles and ciphers.
                                            	However, I found that the development was too much to do alone and the tone of the backrooms community quickly changed to something I disliked.
                                            	So the project is abandoned at the moment.
                                            	However, I still think the tech and idea is interesting and encourage you to check out this video of me explaining the processes.

                                            	All elements are custom made to fit the PS1 aesthetic, so it's taking a little longer than I would have wanted and is currently on the backburner.
                                            	However, I do intend to finish it.
